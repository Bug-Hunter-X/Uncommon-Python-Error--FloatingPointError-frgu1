This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python error: FloatingPointError.  The `bug.py` file contains a function that handles common exceptions (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError), but it does not explicitly handle FloatingPointError.  The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates how to address this by using appropriate exception handling techniques or by performing checks before conducting potentially problematic operations. The FloatingPointError is an important example of how numerical precision and calculations can have unexpected outcomes.
